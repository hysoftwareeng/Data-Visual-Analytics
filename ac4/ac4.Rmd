The name of the graph/network dataset I used is the Facebook dataset from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. Specifically, I used the facebook.tar.gz and used the files starting with nodeId 3437. According to the dataset information on the site, this dataset consists of "circles"/"friend lists" from Facebook and was collected from survey participants. The data has been anonymized, including user information and features. 

```{r}
#install.packages("igraph")
library(igraph)

data_edges = read.table("facebook/3437.edges")
data_features = read.table("facebook/3437.feat")

network = graph.data.frame(d=data_edges, vertices=data_features, directed=F)

total_edges = ecount(network)
total_vertices = vcount(network)
unique_connected_vertices = length(union(x=data_edges$V1, y=data_edges$v2))
disconnected_vertices = total_vertices - unique_connected_vertices

```
